# Data_Cleaning_With_PowerBi

## Business Objectives
The primary objective of the "Data_Cleaning_With_PowerBi" project is to enhance data quality and provide stakeholders with a dynamic, interactive dashboard for data exploration. The project is driven by the need to ensure that our data is not only accurate and reliable but also presented in a visually engaging manner that empowers data-driven decision-making.


## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is at the heart of this project. I undertook a comprehensive data-cleaning process to refine and prepare the provided datasets for analysis. The datasets included Budget, Product, and SalesData, each requiring meticulous attention to detail. This phase involved addressing data discrepancies, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to create a clean, consistent dataset.


## Data Modelling
Data modeling plays a crucial role in structuring and organizing the cleaned data for effective analysis. I constructed various visual models to provide insights into the data. These models include:

The sum of SalesAmount and Count of OrderNumber by Year: This model allows for the examination of sales trends over time, facilitating year-over-year comparisons.
The sum of SalesAmount by ProductGroup: Visualizing sales by product group helps identify top-performing categories and areas for potential improvement.
The sum of SalesAmount by Channel: Analyzing sales by channel offers insights into the effectiveness of different distribution channels.
The sum of SalesAmount by ProductCategory: This model provides a detailed view of sales across various product categories, aiding in product-related decisions.


## Data Visualization
The culmination of our efforts is the creation of an interactive, visualized dashboard that showcases the results of our data cleaning and modeling endeavors. This dashboard serves as a user-friendly interface for exploring the data, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

The attached dashboard represents our commitment to presenting data in a visually engaging and informative manner. It empowers stakeholders to interact with the data dynamically, allowing for deeper exploration and analysis.

In summary, the "Data_Cleaning_With_PowerBi" project embodies our dedication to data quality, organization, and accessibility. I invite you to explore the attached dashboard to experience firsthand the benefits of our data cleaning, modeling, and visualization efforts.
